# BuycraftPM

BuycraftPM is the official port of the Buycraft plugin to PocketMine-MP. BuycraftPM closely follows BuycraftX in both
functionality and behavior as much as possible.

This port is still a work in progress and is *NOT* stable. It may not work properly or completely. By using this plugin,
you acknowledge that this plugin is unstable.

## Compatibility

We are committed to making sure that BuycraftPM works on as many PocketMine-MP forks as reasonably possible. The Buycraft
team tests and ensures that full functionality for BuycraftPM is available on **PocketMine-MP**, **ClearSky** and **Genisys**.

Other forks may work, but are not tested by Buycraft and you may be unable to obtain support for issues that arise.

## Building the plugin

To build the plugin, run `./build-plugin.sh` on any *nix host (OS X and Linux are tested by us).

## Support
If you are a Buycraft customer and you need any assistance with this plugin, please contact our support team through your Buycraft account.
